4.Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
Platform independent: A single program works on different platforms without any modification.
High Performance: JIT (Just In Time compiler) enables high performance in Java. JIT converts the bytecode into machine language and then JVM starts the execution.
Multi-threaded: A flow of execution is known as a Thread. JVM creates a thread which is called main thread. The user can create multiple threads by extending the thread class or by implementing Runnable interface.
For encapsulation, we need to make all the instance variables as private and create setter and getter for those variables. Which in turn will force others to call the setters rather than access the data directly.
